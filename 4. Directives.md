# Enhancing Angular components with Directives

**Directives** are components without templates. There are two types of directives in Angular:

1. Attribute directives
2. Structural directives

**Attribute** directives are ones that enhance the single component by passing them as the attribute to the element (ngModel for example).

**Structural** directives are the directives that directly affect the structure of the template. (ngIf for example, it is used with the \* sign before the directive).

## Custom directives - Structural

In order to generate the directive we use `ng g d name-of-directive`.

This way we generated the directive file which is a class decorated with the `@Directive` decorator and which has some configurations inside its object.
One of the most important properties on this object is the `selector` property which tells angular about the specific selector with which we enhance our element. In order to specify this selector as the directive we use the `[selector-name]` like selector.
We can also prepend it with some element type like `a` and say that this directive should enhance only the anchor elements. They are also standalone nowadays, but if we every meet the module scoped this directive should be incuded in the `declarations` array.
In the case of standalone components, these directives need to be added inside the imports array and used as the simple attributes inside the element.

In order to perform certain operations / methods using the directive, we use the `host` property in the configuration object where we specify the key value pair of the event and the appropriate method for that event.

**Inputs in custom directives** - directives accept inputs as components accept too.
They then can accept the input value as separate input on that component enhanced by directives. To be more convinient, we can define the input with the same name as the directive and this way we can pass it the value directly.

Structural directives should change the DOM based on some value.
When we add \* before the directive, we are telling Angular that this directive goes on the `ng-template` element that wraps the element that should be conditionally shown. In order to get reference to that wrapped element we inject the `TemplateRef` using the dependency injection inside our directive class. Besides that we need to also inject the `ViewContainer` ref. It gives ref of the place on which the component is used, where this template is being used. Then in the case we want to show content between the `ng-template` on the screen we call the `viewContainer.createEmbeddedView()` in order to show content between these tags instead of the `templateRef` which we pass to this method. In opposite case we call the `clear()` method on the `viewContainer`.
