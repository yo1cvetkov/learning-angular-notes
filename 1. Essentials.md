# Angular essentials

In order to be able to generate new Angular project we need:

`npm i -g @angular/cli` and then run the `ng new project-name` to generate a new project.

After the project is generated, we can divide the files in two main groups. First, `src` folder files and second, the rest of the files outside `src` folder. Files outside the `src` folder are mainly configuration files for different parts of the app (ts, angular cli, etc.).

On the other hand `src` folder contains the actual code where we will spend most of our time.

`main.ts` -> file that will be loaded when the app starts.

`index.html` -> main markup file for the initial html code

`styles.css` -> main styles for the app

`app` -> folder where we will create most of the components and combine them

By running the `npm start` which runs the `ng serve` under the hood, we can start our app development server.

## How content ends up on the screen

- `main.ts` file accepts the component
- component (`AppComponent`) has the selector which tells which tag in template it will populate with its content.
- `AppComponent` is a class decorated with `@Component` decorator which accepts the template, styles and tag which it should target and fill up.
- script gets loaded from `main.ts` which on the buildtime gets compiled in `main.js` and referenced in the `index.html` loaded in the browser
- Non HTML-tags (selectors) gets populated with the appropriate components, basically they replace the selector with the template from connected templateUrl file.

## Creating components

We need three files -> `somecomponent.component.ts`, `somecomponent.component.html` and `somecomponent.component.css` file. These can be created manually or by running the CLI command: `ng g c component-name --skip-tests`.

Conventions for selectors -> `app-something`

`standalone: true` -> default in v19+ , not default in older versions
This defines if the component is standalone component if set to true and if it is a module based if it is set to false.

In order to use custom component inside template of another component, we need to import it inside the `imports` array of the `@Component` decorator in the parent component and then use it inside the template for that parent component.

_Referencing the images -> from public folder just by specifying name of the file in v18+, in older versions -> specify the assets path inside the `angular.json` and then reference it_

## Dynamic data inside templates

- All the properties of the component class are available in the template and they can be included in two ways:

1. String interpolation -> using the `{{}}` and specifying the name of the public property between them like `{{ selectedUser.name }}`.
2. Property binding syntax -> besides using the string interpolation between selectors, we can use it inside the attributes of the tags the same way between the "". Usually we won't do this like that and we will use **property bindind**. `[src]="selectedUser.avatar"`

_Computations of values (logic) should not be inside the template and instead it should be computed in the other place_

For these kind of values we add the `getter` and this way we can get the computed value from the class. Inside the class it is created as

```typescript
get imgPath() {
  return this.selectedUser.avatar;
}
```

And inside the template we can use it as the normal variable like `[src]="imgPath"`

## Listening to the events and event binding

1. Inside the element we want the attach the event handler for we specify the property as `(eventtype)` or `(click)` for example.
2. Inside the component ts file we define the `onClick` method which should handle this click event.
3. We attach it and invoke it directly like `(click)="onClick()"`

_Changing the state is as simple as redeclaring the property on the component class_

**Angular state detection mechanism**

`zone.js` is a package that listens for all the possible events could occur in the Angular app and when the specific event occurs it checks the other parts of the app for possible changes inside. It will compare the current snapshot with the previous snapshot and update the app with neccessary changes.

## Signals

Another way of updating state and more modern way is a **signals**. They are essentially a special type of values that notifies Angular when they change.

We import the `signal` function in the app which we wrap around the value of the property inside our component class. Angular is then able to detect all the templates and places where this value has been used when the value of the signal has changed and then it updates these places.

Changing the signal value is as simple as calling the `set` method on that signal value container.

Instead of referencing the signal value as it was the case with the simple properites, now we should invoke this property as the function and access the value by using the dot notation like `{{ selectedUser().name }}`. This way Angular will setup the subscription and all the subscribers will be updated when the specific value to which it subscribed changes.

In sake of difference, with the traditional approach `zone.js` will create a zone around the component and check each component in the zone to see if the value has changed.

With signals it will notify just the subscribers for this signal and not re-check the whole zone and all the components inside that zone.

When it comes to the computed values, using singals we need to have the `computed` function which we will invoke inside the property declaration and compute the value we want to display. This way we don't re-compute the value every time some event in the app occurs, instead it will be re-computed when the signal has changed and this way we will again create subscriprion so that when signal changes the value is re-computed: `imgPath = computed(() => this.selectedUser().avatar)`. Since computed also creates a signal that will be re-computed, we need to invoke it to reference it like we do with signals.

## Component inputs - props

We define inputs of the component by decorating the field with `@Input` decorator. Then on the place where we use the template for this component we can set the value for the input as it is the attribute or by property binding syntax if it should be dynamic.

This decorator also accepts configuration object which has some properties that we can define some rules with.

We can define inputs as signals also. This is more **modern** approach. We do this using the `input` function. We can then for this function provide some default value or leave it empty and provide it generic type value to tell it which type it should be eventually. In order to define it as required we can chain and call the method `required` like this

```typescript
avatar = input.required<string>();
```

Outside of this component, we still use them as before for passing down the props. Input signals are also the readonly so that we can't set different values for them using the `set` method call. They are only changing if the value is changed outside of this component.

## Components Outputs - Emmiting data

Defining the output means defining the custom event that we want to emmit and it should sound like the event that describes what is should do `select` for example and we decorate it with the `@Output` decorator. Then after the name we give it an initial value which should be `new EventEmitter()` which will be able to emit values to the parent component.

```typescript
@Output() select = new EventEmmiter();
```

Then, inside the handler method for that event, we will emit the value by using the `emit` method on the `select` property. Inside the `emit` method we can specify the value we want to emit like `this.id`.

And now when we want to pass the specific event handler to this output, we need to create a method inside the parent component which should accept the emitted event value.

```typescript
// In the parent component
onSelectUser(id: string) {
  ...
}
```

And in the template we pass the function as `onSelectUser($event)` to the `select` output prop we defined. This special `$event` value has the value of the emitted value by the child component.

Ouptut also has its **modern** way of defining the outputs, which in the end is not the signal in any type but just the wrapper to match the code style when using the signal and function based definitions.

```typescript
select = output<string>();
```

## Outputting list of items

In order to dynamically output list of items in template we use `@for` directive with the following things:

```html
<ul>
  @for (user of users; track user.id) {
  <li>
    <app-user [user]="user" />
  </li>
  }
</ul>
```

`track` internally tracks using this unique identifier.

## Outputting conditional content

For this we use `@if` to output conditional elements inside the template:

```html
@if(selectedUser) {
<app-tasks [name]="selectedUser.name" />
} @else {
<p id="fallback">Please select the user...</p>
}
```

## Using ngFor and ngIf

Earlier versions of Angular doesn't support this syntax. We needed to use these structural directives in order to do these kinds of operations...

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let user of users">
    <app-user [user]="user" (select)="onSelectUser($event)" />
  </li>
</ul>
```

And we will also need to import it to the imports array of the component we are using it in.

In order to use the `ngIf` we also need to import it inside the `imports` array and then use it like this:

```html
<app-tasks *ngIf="selectedUser; else fallback" [name]="selectedUser.name" />
<ng-template #fallback>
  <p id="fallback">Please select the user</p>
</ng-template>
```

## Dynamic classes and css styles

We can dynamically determine whether the element should have or should not have the class by saying that `[class.active] = 'isSelected'` where the .active is the class we want to dynamically add based on whether the `isSelected` value is true or false.

## Two-way binding

Two-way binding is the combination of property and event binding.
For that we use the `ngModel` directive. We use it in the specific form:
`[(ngModel)]="enteredTitle"` and in order to do that and enhance element with this directive we need to import the `FormsModule` inside our component imports.
This way when we change the value of the input the enteredTitle will be also changed and that is true for every place on which this value is referenced.

With signals the approach is the same and we don't invoke it.

When it comes to form submissions, by importing `FormsModule` the default behavior of the forms will be prevented automatically.

In order to listen to the form submit event we use the `(ngSubmit)` directive and passing it the method.

## Content projection

If we want to have shared styles and markup for the components in angular we can have an shared folder which should contain these components.
These components should be used as wrapper around some other components which should have the same style.

In the place where we expect some other component to be and we don't know which component it should be we use the `<ng-content />`.

## Transforming template data with pipes

If we have some dynamic content inside the template which we want to convert, we can use the symbol | to do that and after it to specify the specific pipe we want to use. Also to do that we need to import speific pipe inside the component ts file and include it inside the imports array.
For example: `DatePipe` if we want to use the `| date` inside the template.
Also these pipes accept arguments which we can pass to them in order to customize the behavior and we do that after the `:` like `date: "short"`.

## Introduction to services

It's common practice to keep component classes as lean as possible and perform the logic and operations inside the service.

We create service using the `ng g s tasks/tasks --skip-tests`

Also these services are combined with Dependency Injection in order to maintain the same instances across scopes.
To leverage DI inside component class we import it through the constructor, and in the service itself we need the `@Injectable()` decorator.
This decorator accepts the configuration object where we should set `providedIn: 'root'` for now.
There are also other options.

Alternative syntax for injecting the dependency is by using the `inject()` function which accepts the class which we want to inject.
