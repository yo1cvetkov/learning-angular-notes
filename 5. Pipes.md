# Pipes in Angular

Pipes transform the way data is displayed.

## Built in Pipes

**DatePipe**, **DecimalPipes**, ...

As we already know, we add pipes after the string interpolated value by adding the | symbol after which we specify the pipe we want to add for that specific value.
Also, in order to use pipes we need to import it inside the imports array of the compoenent in which we use the pipe.
The pipe is configured by adding the : sign after the pipe and then providing the pipe options.

## Custom pipes

In order to create new pipe we use `ng g p pipe-name`.
This pipe that we created should then be decorated with the `@Pipe` decorator which accepts the configuration object with some important properties.

First, we define the name using the `name` property and also we declare this pipe as standalone pipe.

Also, all of these classes need one specific method and that is the `transform` method which will be automatically executed once the pipe has been called.
Also the value that we use before the pipe will be passed to this pipe and we can then transform it in desired way. Also to be sure that we have the correct method and that all the arguments are correct this pipe class should implement the `PipeTransform` interface. It accepts the value as the first argument and all the other arguments of the pipe as the second argument of the transform function. The value this method returns will be the transformed value by the pipe and will be outputted on the screen.

If our directive has multiple parameters (and by that I mean custom parameters), we should divide them by : sign and specify the arguments one by one.

### Chaining pipes

Let's say that we want to have the temperature pipes which we want to chain with the decimal pipe.
We can chain them by also defining one after another with the | sign prepended.

## Pure pipes

In some cases, after we apply the pipe to some values these values could change and the pipes by default are pure so that they cash the result and only update the values returned if the value has changed which is not case in case of arrays and objects since they are reference values and the reference stays the same even that we know some value has changed. In order to opt out of this behavior we need to set the pipe with the `pure: false` which will cause the result to re-evaluate pipe result when the component is re-rendered.
