# Components and Templates

Every component should only do one thing.

## Content projection using ng-content

When we want to project some passed markup to our reusable component we use the `ng-content`. This way, we tell Angular that it should place any wrapped content on that specific place inside the component.

## Extending built-in elements

Even that the angular selectors are not real html elements, they end up in the DOM anyways. So, this means that if we are using the custom button element for example, it will be rendered as the `app-button` element and inside it there will be `button` HTML element with the content.

Of course, this is not desired behavior and we want to do that differently.

Instead of using the 'app-button' selector we could use the attribute selector which will look something like `[appButton]` and wherever we put this attribute the following markup and template will be applied.
We can go further and apply it like `button[appButton]` and this way we say that every button element anywhere with the `appButton` attribute will have the following markup and styles.
This could be also used with classes and used like `button.button`.

Also, it is considered best practice to prefix the custom attributes with the `app` prefix.

This way we can omit wrapping built in element and use it in the actual place and give it the custom attribute in order to apply styles.

```html
<button appButton></button>
```

**Import the custom components in the imports array** otherwise it will fail silently.

## Content Projection with multiple slots

We can use multiple `ng-content` elements but we have to give the `select` attribute which specifies some class `.icon` for example. And when populating with the actual matching element we have to give that element that very same class which will then

Another pattern is that we, instead of using the class on ng-content, we use the specific element inside the reusable component and then from outside, where we want to project the content inside that element we give the attribute `ngProjectAs` and specify the selector which should not be in format of the class but it should have the very same selector which is defined in the reusable component. For example:

```html
<span>
  <ng-content />
</span>
<span class="icon">
  <ng-content select="icon" />
</span>
```

and in at the actual place where we want to use this reusable component we say

```html
<button appButton>
  Submit
  <span ngProjectAs="icon">-></span>
</button>
```

And it will be put on the place of the `ng-content` with the very same selector.

### Content projection fallbacks

We should always have some fallback content in cases there is no content and we can define it by adding closing `ng-content` and inside it we define the fallback icon.

Also the `ng-content` supports multiple elements inside the `select` attribute separated by the comma, so that this prevents eventual collisons and missinputs. Also this applies to the selectors inside components as they can accept multiple selectors separated by the comma like `button[appButton], a[appButton]`

## Scoping css styles to components

We can change the scope of the CSS styles. By default these styles are component scoped.

In order to make them scope differently, there is an enum called `ViewEncapsulation` which has three possible values -> `None`, `ShadowDom` and `Emulated` which is the default behavior. Emulated makes styles component scoped, while `ShadowDom` implements the feature of browser with the same name. `None` makes styles globally available and applied.

## Component Host elements

When dealing with the custom shared components, sometimes they might not include the specific element inside their template but it should be defined outside. Since every angular component has host element, which is simply the element selected by the selector and we can select it in the css by using the special `:host` selector which enables us to directly target that element.

Just remember that, when we opt out of the component scope, then the `:host` selector won't work anymore.

Also we could generically define which attributes should be added to the host element and that we define in the component configuration object inside the `host` key and there we pass the object with key - value pairs which will be added to the every host element of that component. This way we can provide the pair like `class: 'control'` and every host element of that component will have the `class="control"` attribute.

We can do the same thing using the `@HostBinding` decorator on a property, where we specify the property key and the value for it, and also we can inside the `@HostBinding('class')` define the actual key name if it should differ from the property name.

Also, as we can define binding for the properties, we can also add the event binding and use `@HostListener` to decorate specific method and add the name of the event we want to bind the function for inside parenthesis and after that define the actual method we want to listen for.

These decorators should not be used and they are no recommended instead we should use the host object.

Also, to access host element programatically inside the component we use the DI and we inject the `ElementRef` which will give us access to the host element object node.

## Multiple CSS class conditional bindings

To bind multiple classes inside the html template, we need to use the different syntax than the one when we bind only one. We use the following syntax:

```html
<div
  [class]="{
  active: isActive
}"
></div>
```

where the key is the name of the class and the value is some property which eventually resolves to `true` or `false` and determines whether it should apply the class or not.

## Component Lifecycle methods - ngOnInit

This method runs after all the component inputs are initialized.

In order to define what will happen we use the `ngOnInit` method and when we define it, it will be ran after inputs are initialized.

We can use `constructor` but the best practice is to use these lifecycle methods.

This way, it is easy to make a mistake and misspell the name of the method, so we need to define the interface that will be implemented by the specific component which will require us to define the method properly.
In this case we implement `OnInit` interface which will require us to define the `ngOnInit` method exactly.

## Component Lifecycle

### ngOnChanges hook

This hook gets executed every time one of the input values of the component gets changed.
This hook also gets the `changes` argument which contains all the changes that happen triggering the `ngOnChanges` method.

### ngOnDestroy hook

This hook method gets executed when the components disappears from the screen meaning that the instance is destroyed.

### ngDoCheck

Executed whenever Angular thinks that update might be needed.
This is not the best place to call something and we use it only if we absolutely need to call something inside it.

### ngAfterContentInit

**View** - is a template of the component technically it is the internally managed data structure that holds the reference to the DOM elements rendered by a component.
**Content** - Any other content that might be projected into the view, like something projected inside the `ng-content`.

So as the names suggest, each hook is executed in the specific point in time, based on whether it is bound to View or to Content.

## Template Variables

This is another way of registering values when they are submitted and passing the whole elements to the onSubmit method.

To do that we define the template variable on the input for which we want to take and detect changes and we define it as `#titleInput` for example. Then we pass that value to the onSubmit function passed to the `ngSubmit` callback and the whole `HTMLInputElement` will be available to the `onSubmit` function.

Now we can access all the properties on it, specifically `value` and then choose what to do with it. We also don't need to pass the whole element but we can choose what we want to pass to the onSubmit function.

If we put template variable to the component, it will get access to the component instance and not the actual HTML element.

It is also possible to access the template variables element inside the component without passing it to some function and causing the action to trigger. We can use the `@ViewChild` decorator on the property and this decorator can take any element from the template of this component. `@ViewChild` decorator can accept the class of the specific component and then it will go and find the instance of that class inside the template of the current component and store it. Or we can pass the name of the template variable as the string argument to this decorator and it will give us that element. Type for this property will be `ElementRef<HTMLFormElement>`.

There is also a signal version of this selector with which we get the signal version of the very same element by using the `viewChild` function from angular core package.

The same way we can access the projected elements using the template variables and the `@ContentChild` decorator or `contentChild` signal function.

Also, if we want to do something with these elements and values, we do inside the corresponding lifecycle method ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit depending on the usecase.

## Signal effects

If we use the value of the signal in some place in our code the subscription won't be created and for that to work we need to use special `effect` function which accepts the callback function and that function then sets up the subscription when the signal is called.
This function also provides onCleanup function which accepts the callback in which we define what we need to do on cleanup.

_`@for` has an useful option for a fallback in case the looped list is empty and that is `@empty` block which should include the element which will tell that the list is empty_

Signals, besides set, have also the `update` method which will update the value for that specific signal and this method gets the old value as input parameter into the callback passed to the update method.
