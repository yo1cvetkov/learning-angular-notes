# Modules in Angular

They exist for historic reasons, since Angular modules existed because there were no standalone components.

Instead of importing all the components that the specific component depends on, in module based components we import these components inside the module in which the consuming component is.

We can also mix module based and standalone components.

## Creating modules

We must have `app.module.ts` file.

We need to decorate every module with the `NgModule` decorator. To the configuration object we provide `declarations` array which is the place where we specify the components that will be instantiated inside this module.
What we need to do is to set the specific imported component to be `standalone: false` and also remove imports.

We also need to change the bootstrapping approach which we defined.

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic";
import { AppModule } from "./app/app.module";

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

Since, we will add multiple components inside the AppModule, we need to define which component it should display on bootstrap by specifying `bootstrap: [AppComponent]`

If we want to add component to our module that are still standalone we need to list them inside the `imports` array. In order for the app to work we also need to import `BrowserModule` inside the imports array. Also every other built-in module that we want to use has to be imported inside the imports array here.

Also, when using the modules with the BrowserModule all the pipes are included so we don't need to import it again and again.

## Creating and using the shared modules

We can also define multiple modules and then share them with one another.
For that we can create shared module where we will put all the shared components.

In order to generate modules `ng g m module-name`. These won't have bootstrap option inside their module config.
Declarations should contain the components that we have inside this module.
The difference is that they will have `exports` array which should contain all the components that will be shared with other modules when we import this module inside them.

Then we can remove all the declarations for these components inside our `AppModule` and just import this module.

_BrowserModule is imported only in the AppModule while on other places in order to use same features we use the CommonModule_
